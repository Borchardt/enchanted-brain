## Requirements

### Part 1: Mental Imagery
TODO

### Part 2: Color/Emotion - App-Only
| Emotions          | Artist       | Song                                                 | Duration |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Serenity/Calm     | Faur√©        | Pavane - initial excerpt                             | 2:30     |
| Sadness/Nostalgia | Grieg        | Elegiac Melodies - No. 2, Last Spring excerpt        | 2:00     |
| Happiness/Joy     | Beethoven    | Symphony No. 7 - 4th movement - finale excerpt.      | 2:00     |
| Anger             | Shostakovich | Chamber Symphony in C minor, Op. 110a - 2nd movement | 3:00     |

* The audience will listen to the orchestra play the above four pieces of music.
* Each audience member will use the app to pick from six available colors (RGB, CMY).
* It's possible that we will want audience members of the final rehearsal to be able to choose emotions instead.
* The audience member can pick a new color at any time, but the app will give a gentle reminder every 20 seconds.
* During the intermission (after the four songs), each audience member's app will display both their own choices as well as the overall audience distribution. Let's call this the "results" screen.
* The app will move from one song to the next as the event progresses without user input

### Part 3: Color/Emotion - App + Central Visualization
* The audience will listen to the orchestra play the Coriolan overture.
* The audience will be randomly split into two groups.
    * In group A, the functionality is the same as the app-only section.
    * In group B, the audience member will instead be picking emotions: Joy, sadness, anger, fear, [disgust].
* There will also be a central display in the event venue visualizing the audience's choices as they come in. This should function like a "mood ring" in the sense that it shows the most recent audience choices.

### Part 4: Chills

`POST /Choices`
```js

## Concert Experience Websocket API
The websocket API will be used to guide the mobile app through the concert experience. At appropriate times, it will trigger the app to proceed to the next part of the concert.

### 1 - Connect and welcome
Send `authentication`
```js
{
  eventId: 'CONCERT_LAUSANNE_2019',
  token: String,                        // access token from AWS Cognito
}
```

**Response**
```js
{
  eventStage: 'WELCOME',
}
```

After the client connects, the mobile app should display a welcome screen that asks the user to just listen to the concert. The first part of the concert will be the mental imagery, which requires the user to close their eyes, listen to the song, and pay attention to the images that come to mind.

### 2 - Ask for mental imagery response
Listen for `EVENT_STAGE_CHANGED`
```js
{
  eventStage: 'CHOICE_IMAGERY',
}
```

After the response is submitted, display a thank you screen and ask the user to wait for the next part of the concert.

### 3 - Ask for color choices
Listen for `EVENT_STAGE_CHANGED`
```js
{
  eventStage: 'CHOICE_COLOR',
}
```

At this point, display the color picker UI and allow the user to start picking away.

### 4 - Ask for emotion choices
Listen for `EVENT_STAGE_CHANGED`
```js
{
  eventStage: 'CHOICE_EMOTION',
}
```

After the concert attendees are told just what the heck all this color picking is all about, there will be one more piece of music in this section. For this song, some users will be asked to submit emotions instead of colors. Those users will receive this event.

### 5 - Intermission and end
Listen for `EVENT_STAGE_CHANGED`
```js
{
  eventStage: 'END',
  songs: [
    {
      displayName: String,
      startTime: String,
      endTime: Number,
    },
    ...
  ],
  colors: [
    {
      timestamp: String,
      choices: {
        COLOR_BLUE: Number,
        COLOR_GREEN: Number,
        COLOR_RED: Number,
        ...
      },
    },
    ...
  ],
  imagery: {
    [String]: Number,
    [word]: count,
  },
}
```

The app will not be used in the concert after the intermission. At this point, the aggregated responses/visualizations will be available in the app and the websocket connection can be closed.

## Central Visualization Websocket API

### Event: new choices aggregated
Listen for `AGGREGATE_CHOICES_UPDATED`
```js
{
  colors: {
    COLOR_BLUE: Number,
    COLOR_GREEN: Number,
    COLOR_RED: Number,
    ...
  }
}
```
